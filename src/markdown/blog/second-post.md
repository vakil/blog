- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- Lists like this one
- [Links](https://example.com)
- `code snippets`

```javascript
// You can even include code blocks
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Images

You can include images using Markdown syntax:
